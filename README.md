## Edits from Original Design
- **Data Storage Changes:** 
     - Originally planned to use a database like SQLite, but due to time constraints from the CodeDay project, we pivoted to an offline app using AsyncStorage.
     - While this may be a simplier approach it was something that was realistic with the new time frame we had and also introduced offline functionality so we chose this path. 
- **Design Changes:** 
    - Decided to pivot from an online app to a more reliable offline app accessible with or without internet connection. 
    - Added some new UI components, like react natives Animated API for animations. 


- **Feature Changes:** 
    - The original plan included deck sharing, but since we moved to an offline model with AsyncStorage, this feature was removed.
    - Future versions could reintroduce online sharing by integrating a database.


## Future Improvements

**Data Storage:** 
- If we want to reintroduce deck sharing, weâ€™ll need to implement a backend database such as Firebase or SQLite.
- Requires an internet connection causing the app to shift from offline to an online system

**Additional Feature Ideas:**
- Quiz Mode: add a game like feature to quiz you. (MC questions, fill in the blank, etc.)
- Import/Export Decks: give users the option to import ot export decks in a JSON format 
- Dark Mode: Give users the option to change color theme from light to dark
